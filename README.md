This repository contains the code used in my thesis project titled "Advancing Water Injection Dredging: Analysis of Production Rates, Power Requirement, and Dredging Processes.

A new processer is developed, called WIDProcessor. A new activity is developed, called produce_amount_activity. 

Both elements allow the user to run the Python file WID_PepijnPrins.ipynb, where a simple simulation of a water injection dredging vessel can be conducted.
